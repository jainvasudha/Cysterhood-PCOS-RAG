Many problems occur as a result of this increase of hormones, including:\n\nPCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:\n\nNormally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.\n\nIn many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid (cyst) around them. The affected ovary may be slightly enlarged. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.\n\nWomen with PCOS have cycles where ovulation does not occur every month which may contribute toinfertilityThe other symptoms of this disorder are due to the high levels of male hormones.\n\nMost of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start. Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of PCOS include changes in the menstrual cycle, such as:\n\nOther symptoms of PCOS include:\n\nThe development of male characteristics is not typical of PCOS and may indicate another problem. The following changes may indicate another problem apart from PCOS:\n\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a pelvic exam. The exam may show:\n\nThe following health conditions are common in women with PCOS:\n\nYour provider will check your weight and body mass index (BMI) and measure your belly size.\n\nBlood tests can be done to check hormone levels. These tests may include:\n\nOther blood tests that may be done include:\n\nYour provider may also perform or order an ultrasound of your pelvis to look at your ovaries.",

Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.\n\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\n\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood. This is because:\n\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\n\nGestational diabetesis diagnosed when high blood sugar develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\n\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\n\nA high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\n\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months. People may be very sick by the time they are diagnosed.\n\nAfter many years, diabetes can lead to other serious problems. These problems are known as diabetes complications, and include:\n\nAurine analysismay show high urine sugar. But a urine test alone does not diagnose diabetes.\n\nYour health care provider may suspect that you have diabetes if your blood sugar level is 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 11.1 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or higher. To confirm the diagnosis, one or more of the following tests must be done.\n\nBlood tests:\n\nScreening for type 2 diabetes in people who have no symptoms is recommended for:\n\nIn 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there was not enough evidence to recommend screening for type 2 diabetes in all people 18 years old or younger.

Painful menstruation is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s.\n\nPainful menstrual periods fall into two groups, depending on the cause:\n\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs around the time that menstrual periods first begin in otherwise healthy young women. In most cases, this pain is not related to a specific problem with the uterus or other pelvic organs. Increased activity of the hormone prostaglandin, which is produced in the uterus, is thought to play a role in this condition.\n\nSecondary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that develops later in women who have had normal periods.

It refers to low blood sugar (glucose) in the first few days after birth.\n\nBabies need blood sugar (glucose) for energy. Most of that glucose is used by the brain.\n\nThe baby gets glucose from the mother through the placenta before birth. After birth, the baby gets glucose from the mother through her milk, or from formula. The baby can also produce some glucose in the liver.\n\nThe glucose level can drop if:\n\nNeonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the glucose level of a newborn causes symptoms or is below the range considered safe for the baby's age. It occurs in about 1 to 3 out of every 1000 births.\n\nLow blood sugar level is more likely in infants with one or more of these risk factors:\n\nInfants with low blood sugar may not have symptoms. If your baby has one of the risk factors for low blood sugar, nurses in the hospital will check your baby's blood sugar level, even if there are no symptoms.\n\nAlso, the blood sugar level is usually checked for babies with these symptoms:\n\nNewborns at risk for hypoglycemia should have a blood test to measure blood sugar levels frequently after birth. This will be done using a heel stick. The health care provider should continue taking blood tests until the baby's glucose level stays normal for about 12 to 24 hours.\n\nOther possible tests include newborn screening for metabolic disorders, such as blood and urine tests.",

    "text": "An active lifestyle and exercise routine, along with eating healthy foods in limited amounts, is the best way to start trying to lose weight.\n\nCalories used in exercise and daily living > calories eaten = weight loss.\n\nThis means that to lose weight, the number of calories you burn by daily living and exercising needs to be greater than the number of calories from the foods you eat and drink. Even if you work out a lot, if you eat more calories than you burn, you will gain weight.\n\nAnother way to look at this is that a woman aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 1,800 calories a day to maintain her normal weight. A man aged 30 to 50 years old who does not exercise needs about 2,200 calories to maintain his normal weight.\n\nFor every hour of exercise they do, they would burn:\n\nEven if you don't change the amount of calories in your diet, but you do add activity to your daily life, you'll lose weight or gain less weight.\n\nAn exercise weight-loss program that works needs to be fun and keep you motivated. It helps to have a specific goal. Your goal might be managing a health condition, reducing stress, improving your stamina, or being able to buy clothes in a smaller size. Your exercise program may also be a way for you to be with other people. Exercise classes or exercising with a buddy are both good social outlets.\n\nYou may have a hard time starting an exercise routine, but once you do, you will begin to notice other benefits. Improved sleep and self-esteem might be a couple of them. Other benefits you may not notice include increased bone and muscle strength and a lower risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nYou do not need to join a gym to get exercise. If you have not exercised or been active in a long time, be sure to start off slowly to prevent injuries. Taking a slow 10-minute walk twice a week is a good start. Then make it more brisk over time. Add time and frequency if you can.\n\nYou can also try joining a dance, yoga, or karate class. You could also join a baseball or bowling team, or even a mall-walking group. The social aspects of these groups can be rewarding and motivating.\n\nThe most important thing is that you do exercises that you enjoy and are practical so that it is easier to sustain what you are doing.",

About half to two-thirds of miscarriages in the first trimester are linked with extra or missing chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures in each cell that contain genes, the instructions for how people look and function. When an egg and sperm unite, two sets of chromosomes — one from each parent — join together. But if either set has fewer or more chromosomes than usual, that can lead to a miscarriage.\n\nChromosome conditions might lead to:\n\nMolar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy.With a molar pregnancy, a fetus doesn't develop. This most often happens if both sets of chromosomes come from the sperm. A molar pregnancy is linked with irregular growth of the placenta, the pregnancy-associated organ that gives an unborn baby oxygen and nutrients.\n\nWith a partial molar pregnancy, a fetus may develop, but it can't survive. A partial molar pregnancy happens when there is an extra set of chromosomes, also called triploidy. The extra set is often contributed from the sperm but can also be contributed from the egg.\n\nMolar and partial molar pregnancies can't continue because they can cause serious health problems. Sometimes, they can be linked with changes of the placenta that lead to cancer in the pregnant person.\n\nIn a few cases, having certain health conditions might lead to miscarriage. Examples include:\n\nRoutine activities such as these don't cause a miscarriage:\n\nSome people who've had a miscarriage blame themselves. They think they lost the pregnancy because they fell, had a bad scare or other reasons. But most of the time, miscarriage happens because of a random event that is no one's fault.\n\nVarious factors raise the risk of miscarriage, including:\n\nSometimes, pregnancy tissue that stays in the uterus after a miscarriage can lead to a uterine infection about 1 to 2 days later. The infection is called a septic miscarriage. Symptoms include:\n\nCall your health care professional's office or your local OB triage or emergency department if you have these symptoms. The illness can get worse fast and become life-threatening without treatment.\n\nHeavy bleeding from the vagina, called a hemorrhage, is another miscarriage complication. Along with the bleeding, a hemorrhage often happens with symptoms such as:\n\nGet medical care at once. Some people who have a hemorrhage need blood from a donor or surgery.\n\nOften, there's nothing you can do to prevent a miscarriage. Instead, focus on taking good care of yourself and your unborn baby:\n\nIf you have a long-term health condition, work with your health care team to keep it under control.",

Examples include:\n\nOvulation is the release of an egg from one of the ovaries. It often happens about midway through the menstrual cycle, although the exact timing may vary.\n\nIn preparation for ovulation, the lining of the uterus, or endometrium, thickens. The pituitary gland in the brain stimulates one of the ovaries to release an egg. The wall of the ovarian follicle ruptures at the surface of the ovary. The egg is released.\n\nFinger-like structures called fimbriae sweep the egg into the neighboring fallopian tube. The egg travels through the fallopian tube, propelled in part by contractions in the fallopian tube walls. Here in the fallopian tube, the egg may be fertilized by a sperm.\n\nIf the egg is fertilized, the egg and sperm unite to form a one-celled entity called a zygote. As the zygote travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus, it begins dividing rapidly to form a cluster of cells called a blastocyst, which resembles a tiny raspberry. When the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it implants in the lining of the uterus and pregnancy begins.\n\nIf the egg isn't fertilized, it's simply reabsorbed by the body — perhaps before it even reaches the uterus. About two weeks later, the lining of the uterus sheds through the vagina. This is known as menstruation.\n\nFactors that may increase your risk of amenorrhea include:\n\nThe causes of amenorrhea can cause other problems as well. These include:",

    "text": "Obesity is a complex disease involving having too much body fat. You might think of obesity as a cosmetic concern. But it's a medical condition that increases the risk of many other diseases and health conditions. These can include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, sleep apnea and certain cancers.\n\nThere are many reasons why some people have trouble losing weight. Often, obesity results from inherited, physiological and environmental factors, combined with diet, physical activity and exercise choices.\n\nThe good news is that even modest weight loss can improve or prevent the health conditions associated with obesity. A healthier diet, increased physical activity and behavior changes can help you lose weight. Prescription medicines and weight-loss procedures are other options for treating obesity.\n\nBody mass index, also known as BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. To calculate BMI, multiply weight in pounds by 703, divide by height in inches and then divide again by height in inches. Or divide weight in kilograms by height in meters squared. There are several online calculators available that help calculate BMI.\n\nSee BMI calculator.\n\nAsians with a BMI of 23 or higher may have an increased risk of health problems.\n\nFor most people, BMI provides a reasonable estimate of body fat. However, BMI doesn't directly measure body fat. Some people, such as muscular athletes, may have a BMI in the obesity category even though they don't have excess body fat.\n\nMany healthcare professionals also measure around a person's waist to help guide treatment decisions. This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health conditions are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist circumference over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight-loss program to track progress.\n\nIf you're concerned about your weight or weight-related health conditions, ask your healthcare professional about obesity management. You and your healthcare team can evaluate your health risks and discuss your weight-loss options.\n\nThere is a problem with\n                                information submitted for this request.

Your body stores these excess calories as fat.\n\nIn the United States, most people's diets are too high in calories — often from fast food and high-calorie beverages. People with obesity might eat more calories before feeling full, feel hungry more often, or eat more due to stress or anxiety.\n\nMany people who live in Western countries now have jobs that are much less physically demanding, so they don't tend to burn as many calories at work. Even daily activities use fewer calories courtesy of conveniences such as remote controls, escalators, online shopping, and drive-thru restaurants and banks.\n\nObesity often results from a combination of causes and contributing factors:\n\nThe genes passed down to you from your parents may affect the amount of body fat you store and where that fat is distributed. Genetics also may play a role in how efficiently your body converts food into energy, how your body regulates your appetite and how your body burns calories during exercise.\n\nObesity tends to run in families. That's not just because of the genes they share. Family members also tend to share similar eating and activity habits.\n\nIn some people, obesity can be traced to a medical cause, such as hypothyroidism, Cushing syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome and other conditions. Medical conditions, such as arthritis, also can lead to decreased activity, which may result in weight gain.\n\nSome medicines can lead to weight gain if you don't compensate through diet or activity. These medicines include steroids, some antidepressants, antiseizure medicines, diabetes medicines, antipsychotic medicines and certain beta blockers.\n\nSocial and economic factors are linked to obesity. It's hard to avoid obesity if you don't have safe areas to walk or exercise. You may not have learned healthy ways of cooking. Or you may not have access to healthier foods. Also, the people you spend time with may influence your weight. You're more likely to develop obesity if you have friends or relatives with obesity.\n\nObesity can occur at any age, even in young children. But as you age, hormonal changes and a less active lifestyle increase your risk of obesity. The amount of muscle in your body also tends to decrease with age. Lower muscle mass often leads to a decrease in metabolism. These changes also reduce calorie needs and can make it harder to keep off excess weight. If you don't consciously control what you eat and become more physically active as you age, you'll likely gain weight.\n\nEven if you have one or more of these risk factors, it doesn't mean that you're destined to develop obesity. You can counteract most risk factors through diet, physical activity and exercise. Behavior changes, medicines and procedures for obesity also can help.\n\nPeople with obesity are more likely to develop a number of potentially serious health conditions, including:\n\nObesity can diminish overall quality of life. You may not be able to do physical activities that you used to enjoy. You may avoid public places. People with obesity may even encounter discrimination.\n\nOther weight-related issues that may affect your quality of life include:\n\nObesity care at Mayo Clinic\n\nConnect with others like you for support and answers to your questions in theBariatric Surgery & Weight Loss support groupon Mayo Clinic Connect, a patient community.\n\n2 RepliesFri, Dec 05, 2025\n\n239 RepliesTue, Dec 02, 2025\n\n8 RepliesMon, Dec 01, 2025",

About 15 million women in the United States have diabetes, or about 1 in every 9 adult women.1\n\nDiabetes is a disease caused by high levels of blood sugar (glucose) in your body. This can happen when your body does not make insulin or does not use insulin correctly.\n\nInsulin is a hormone made in the pancreas, an organ near your stomach. Insulin helps the glucose from food get into your body's cells for energy. If your body does not make enough insulin, or your body does not use the insulin correctly, the glucose stays and builds up in your blood.\n\nOver time, this extra glucose can lead to prediabetes or diabetes. Diabetes puts you at risk for other serious and life-threatening health problems, such asheart disease, stroke, blindness, and kidney damage.\n\nThe three main types of diabetes are:\n\nA risk factor is something that puts you at a higher risk for a disease compared to the average person.\n\nRisk factors fortype 1 diabetesin women and girls include:\n\nRisk factors fortype 2 diabetesin women and girls include:4\n\nIf you have any of these risk factors, talk to your doctor about ways to lower your risk for diabetes. You can also take theDiabetes Risk Testand talk about the results with your doctor.\n\nType 1diabetes usually develops in children and young adults, but it can happen at any age.5It is more common in non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks than in Hispanic populations.6About 5% of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes.1If you have a parent or sibling with the disease you may be more likely to develop type 1 diabetes.\n\nType 2diabetes is more common in adults, especially in people who are 45 and older, have a family history of diabetes, or have overweight or obesity. About 90–95% of people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in children and teens, which may be because more of them have overweight and obesity.7,8,9\n\nYes. It is more common for certain racial and ethnic groups to have diabetes.

However, diabetes affects women differently than men.\n\nCompared with men with diabetes, women with diabetes have:12\n\nYes. The longer you have type 2 diabetes, the higher your risk for developing serious medical problems from diabetes. Also, if you smoke and have diabetes, you are even more likely to develop serious medical problems from diabetes, compared with people who have diabetes and do not smoke.14\n\nThe extra glucose in the blood that leads to diabetes can damage your nerves and blood vessels. Nerve damage from diabetes can lead to pain or a permanent loss of feeling in your hands, feet, and other parts of your body.15\n\nBlood vessel damage from diabetes can also lead to:\n\nWomen with diabetes are also at higher risk for:\n\nResearchers do not know the exact causes of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Researchers do know that inheriting certain genes from your family can raise your risk for developing diabetes. Obesity is also a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can also cause type 2 diabetes. And the more you smoke the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes and other serious health problems if you already have diabetes.16\n\nWeight loss can help control type 2 diabetes so that you are healthier. Quitting smoking can also help you control your blood sugar levels. Being a healthy weight and not smoking can help all women be healthier.\n\nBut, obesity and smoking do not always cause diabetes. Some women who are overweight or obese or smoke never develop diabetes. Also, women who are a normal weight or only slightly overweight can develop diabetes if they have otherrisk factors, such as a family history of diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetessymptoms are usually more severe and may develop suddenly.\n\nType 2 diabetesmay not cause any signs or symptoms at first. Symptoms can develop slowly over time. You may not notice them right away.\n\nCommon signs and symptoms of type 1 and type 2 diabetes include:\n\nMaybe. You should be tested for diabetes if you are between 40 and 70 years old and are overweight or obese. Your doctor may recommend testing earlier than age 40 if you also have otherrisk factors for diabetes. Also, talk to your doctor about diabetes testing if you havesigns or symptomsof diabetes. Your doctor will use a blood test to see if you have diabetes.\n\nIf the testing shows that your blood sugar levels are high, you can begin making healthy changes to your eating habits and getting more physical activity to help prevent diabetes.\n\nPrediabetes means your blood sugar (glucose) level is higher than normal, but it is lower than the diabetes range. It also means you are at higher risk of getting type 2 diabetes andheart disease.\n\nAs many as 27 million American women have prediabetes.17If you have prediabetes, you can make healthy changes, such as doing some type of physical activity on most days, to lower your risk of getting diabetes and return to normal blood sugar levels. Losing 7% of your body weight (or 14 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds) can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes by more than half. If you have prediabetes, get your blood glucose checked every year by a doctor or nurse.4\n\nDiabetes treatment includes managing your blood sugar levels to control your symptoms. You can help control your blood sugar levels by eating healthy and getting regular physical activity.\n\nWith type 1 diabetes, you also will need to take insulinthrough shots or an insulin pump. Insulin cannot be taken as a pill.\n\nType 2 diabetes treatment also may include taking medicine to control your blood sugar.Over time, people with type 2 diabetes make less and less of their own insulin. This may mean that you will need to increase your medicines or start taking insulin shots to keep your diabetes in control.\n\nLearn more about controlling diabetes at theNational Diabetes Education Programwebsite.\n\nResearchers do not know how to prevent type 1 diabetes. Researchers are still looking for ways to prevent type 1 diabetes in women and girls by studying their close relatives who have diabetes.\n\nYes.

You can manage symptoms with lifestyle and medical treatments.\n\nPCOS is a condition that affects those assigned female at birth (AFAB) during childbearing years.\n\nMany people with PCOS don’t know they have it. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)estimates that up to 70% of people AFAB worldwide with PCOS have not received a proper diagnosis.\n\nPCOS affects the ovaries, the reproductive organs that produceestrogen and progesterone— hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle.\n\nThe ovaries also produce a small amount of male sex hormones calledandrogens.\n\nThe three main features of PCOS are:\n\nHealth experts don’t know exactly what causes PCOS. They believe that high levels of androgens prevent the ovaries from producing hormones and making eggs normally.\n\nGenes, insulin resistance, and inflammation have all been linked to excess androgen production.\n\nA 2019 study suggests that PCOS mayrun in families. While having a close relative who lives with PCOS increases the odds that you might have it too, it doesn’t mean you will.\n\nExperts are still trying to determine exactly how genes contribute to PCOS. Many genes are likely involved.\n\nResearch from 2023 estimates that between65% and 95%of people with PCOS haveinsulin resistanceandhyperinsulinemia.\n\nWhen cells can’t useinsulinproperly, the body’s demand for insulin increases. The pancreas makes more to compensate, resulting in hyperinsulinemia. Extra insulin triggers the ovaries to produce more male sex hormones.\n\nObesityis a major cause of insulin resistance. Both obesity and insulin resistancecan increase your riskoftype 2 diabetes.\n\nPeople with PCOS often have increased levels ofinflammationin their bodies. Having obesity can also contribute to inflammation. Studies havelinked excess inflammationto higher androgen levels.\n\nSome people start seeing symptoms around the time of theirfirst period. Others only discover they have PCOS after gaining weight or experiencing difficulties getting pregnant.\n\nThe most common PCOS symptoms are:\n\nA pelvic exam can find problems with your ovaries or other parts of your reproductive tract.\n\nBlood tests can check for higher levels of male sex hormones. Your doctor might also check yourcholesterol,insulin, andtriglyceride levelsto evaluate your risk for related conditions like heart disease and diabetes.\n\nDoctors typically provide a diagnosis of PCOS in those who meetat least twoof the following Rotterdam criteria for PCOS:\n\nYour doctor might ask whether you’ve had symptoms like acne, excess face and body hair growth, and weight gain.\n\nHaving higher androgen levels can affect your fertility and other aspects of your health.\n\nTo get pregnant, you must ovulate. Those who don’t ovulate regularly don’t release as many eggs.

Many with PCOS may experiencedepressionandanxiety.\n\nAccording to a study of 8,612 women with and without PCOS, compared to those without PCOS,8.5% morewomen reported a higher prevalence of depression symptoms.\n\nAnd 10.8% more reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms.\n\nPCOS interrupts the menstrual cycle and makes it harder — but not impossible — to get pregnant.\n\nResearch from 2025 using data from 2021 estimates that PCOS-related infertility affects about32.5%of people.\n\nThis condition can alsoincrease the riskof:\n\nFertility treatmentscan help stimulate ovulation, though these also mayraise your riskfor pregnancy complications.\n\nIf you’re looking to get pregnant, consider speaking with a fertility specialist for more guidance.\n\nIt may still bepossible to get pregnanteven if you don’t ovulate or menstruate regularly. It’s best to usecontraceptionand barrier methods, even if you have PCOS, if you don’t want to conceive.\n\nTreatment for PCOS usually starts with lifestyle changes like weight management, diet, and exercise.\n\nMaintaining a moderate weight can help regulate your menstrual cycle and improve PCOS symptoms while helping to improve:\n\nA 2019 study on the effect of a low carbohydrate diet for PCOS found that itcan help with:\n\nTo see these improvements, however, you’ll need to follow the diet consistently.

However, not enough evidence exists to recommend a specific diet for this condition.\n\nThe international PCOS guidelines suggest getting at least150 minutesof moderate activity (anything you can talk but not quite sing doing), 75 minutes of intense exercise, or both each week.\n\nDepending on your fitness level, you may or may not be able to reach this goal. That’s OK — just focus on what you can do for now. Remember: The goal is to move more in general.\n\nBirth control pills and other medications can help regulate the menstrual cycle and treat PCOS symptoms like hair growth and acne.\n\nTakingprogestindaily can help:\n\nThese hormones come in apill,patch, orvaginal ring.\n\nMetforminis used to treat type 2 diabetes by improving insulin levels.\n\nA 2023 study found that taking metformin can alsohelp improveinsulin levels in those with PCOS.

    "title": "Could this amino acid improve glucose control in diabetes?",
    "text": "The discovery of a previously unknown effect of the amino acid alanine on cell metabolism could lead to new drugs for short-term control of blood glucose.\n\nAmino acids are small building block molecules that the body uses to make proteins. Alanine is classed as a nonessential amino acid because the body can make it without having to source it from food.\n\nScientists at the Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School, both in Boston, MA, have now uncovered a new and unique role for alanine by studying it in laboratory cells and mice.\n\nIt appears that the amino acid activates an enzyme called AMP kinase (AMPK) that increases energy production in cells. This results in a short-term reduction in blood glucose that does not involve insulin.\n\nAstudy paperabout the findings now features in the journalMolecular Metabolism.\n\n“AMPK,” says senior study author Dr. Mary-Elizabeth Patti, who is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an investigator at the Joslin Diabetes Center, “is an enzyme in cells throughout the body that is activated when nutrient supplies are low, or in response to exercise.”\n\nIt is possible that the discovery about alanine’s effect on AMPK could eventually lead to a pill that a person can swallow before a meal to exert a temporary effect on glucose metabolism.\n\n“However, this is early-stage research, and we need to test the concept both in mice and ultimately in humans,” Dr. Patti adds.\n\nScientists already knew that AMPK helps regulate metabolism at the cell, tissue, and systemic level in response to nutrient levels.\n\nAMPK achieves this in several ways. In cells, for instance, when it receives the trigger signal, it switches on genes that ramp up energy production.\n\n“AMPK is a good thing,” Dr. Patti explains, “and it also can be activated by a variety of treatments fortype 2 diabetes, such as metformin.”\n\nType 2 diabetes develops frominsulin resistance, a condition in which the body does not respond properly toinsulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb and use blood sugar, or glucose.\n\nAround90–95 percentof the 30 million people in the United States withdiabeteshave type 2. Although type 2 diabetes typically occurs after the age of 45, it is becoming increasingly common in younger adults and children.\n\nDr. Patti and her team wanted to find out whether any particular amino acids activated AMPK. They also wanted to understand how the trigger mechanism works at the cell and systemic level.\n\nThey started by screening several amino acids using rat liver cells. They used liver cells because the liver plays a key role in controlling glucose in the body.\n\n“Alanine was the one amino acid that was consistently able to activate AMPK,” Dr. Patti notes.\n\nIn the next stage of the study, the team confirmed that alanine was triggering AMPK’s metabolic activity. They also ran tests to confirm this in liver cells from humans and mice.\n\nAll the tests showed that alanine triggered AMPK in rat, mouse, and human liver cells, regardless of whether the glucose levels in the cells were high or low.\n\nThe scientists then ran tests on live mice. They saw that levels of AMPK in the mice went up when they gave the animals oral doses of alanine. They also found that mice given alanine before receiving a glucose dose developed lower levels of glucose.\n\nFurther tests revealed that the same mechanism was present in mice with and withoutobesity, even though glucose often metabolizes differently in under- and overweight mice.\n\nIn a final set of experiments, the researchers revealed that the changes in glucose levels were not the result of insulin and glucagon secretion. Instead, they were due to AMPK helping the liver use glucose and release less of it by changing a cell metabolism process.\n\n“All these data together suggest that amino acids, and specifically alanine, may be a unique potential way to modify glucose metabolism.”\n\nDr. Mary-Elizabeth Patti",

    "title": "How to Manage PCOS as a Teen",
    "text": "Polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) usually begins during the teenage or young adult years. It causes symptoms such as hair growth on the face or chest, acne, andirregular periods. Each person who has PCOS can have a different combination and timing of these symptoms.PCOS typicallyruns in families, and researchers have recently identified some of the genes involved in the syndrome.\n\nThis article reviews how to diagnose and manage PCOS in teenagers.\n\nSymptoms of PCOS usually appear during the teenage or young adult years.\n\nThe Rotterdam diagnostic criteria include having at least two of the following:\n\nSometimes, it takes time for teenagers to get a diagnosis of PCOS because many of the symptoms are similar to normal changes of adolescence. For example, many teens have irregular periods,acne, or rapid body or facial hair growth, even if they don’t have PCOS.\n\nIf your healthcare provider suspects that you have PCOS, you might have some diagnostic tests.\n\nBlood tests are used to check the levels of certain hormones, including FSH, LH, DHEA-S, and testosterone.\n\nYour healthcare provider may do an ultrasound of your ovaries to check forcysts, which are common in PCOS. To get the best view, atransvaginal ultrasoundmay be used. This is where the ultrasound probe is placed into the vagina instead of on top of the abdomen.\n\nIf you are a virgin or uncomfortable with the procedure, your healthcare provider may consider using abdominal ultrasound, but the ovaries are not as clearly visible with this test. Ovarian cysts can occur with PCOS, although they aren't necessary for a diagnosis.\n\nIf you are diagnosed with PCOS, you should know thatit’s not deadlyor terribly serious. Your healthcare provider may recommend certain lifestyle changes and regular follow-up visits to help you manage the effects of your condition.\n\nManaging weight can help reduce some of the hormonal imbalances for some people who have PCOS. People with PCOS often have a harder time losing weight.It might be helpful to see a dietitian, who may suggest strategies to help you reach your optimal weight—such as getting regular exercise and making sure that your meals include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n\nIt's also important that you talk to your healthcare provider if you aren't getting a regular period. Your practitioner might prescribe thebirth control pillor other hormonal supplements to ensure that you get a regular period.\n\nYou should also talk to your healthcare provider about any annoying or embarrassing symptoms that could be caused by your PCOS, such as acne or unwanted hair growth. Often, procedures or medications can help reduce these effects.\n\nRichardson MR.Current perspectives in polycystic ovary syndrome.Am Fam Physician; 68(4):697-704.\n\nPanda PK, Rane R, Ravichandran R, Singh S, Panchal H.Genetics of PCOS: A systematic bioinformatics approach to unveil the proteins responsible for PCOS.Genom Data. 2016;8:52-60. doi:10.1016/j.gdata.2016.03.008\n\nTeede HJ, Misso ML, Costello MF, et al.Recommendations from the international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome.Hum Reprod. 2018;33(9):1602-1618. doi:10.1093/humrep/dey256\n\nDumitrescu R, Mehedintu C, Briceag I, Purcarea VL, Hudita D.The polycystic ovary syndrome: an update on metabolic and hormonal mechanisms.J Med Life; 8(2):142-5.\n\nPenn Medicine.5 myths about polycystic ovary syndrome.\n\nDe melo AS, Dos reis RM, Ferriani RA, Vieira CS.Hormonal contraception in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: choices, challenges, and noncontraceptive benefits.Open Access J Contracept. 2017;8:13-23. doi:10.2147/OAJC.S85543\n\nByNicole Galan, RNNicole Galan, RN, is a registered nurse and the author of \"The Everything Fertility Book.\"",
